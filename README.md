## Automation With PlayWright with TypeScript 

To integrate team notifications for test results in your Playwright framework, you can use a combination of Playwright's built-in reporters and external notification services like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or email. Here is an example of how you can set up notifications using a custom reporter and a Slack webhook.

Step 1: Install Required Packages
First, install the necessary packages to send HTTP requests. You can use axios for this purpose.

```
npm install axios
```

Step 2: Create a Custom Reporter
Create a custom reporter that sends notifications to your team. Here is an example of a custom reporter that sends notifications to a Slack channel using a webhook URL.

Step 3: Update Playwright Configuration
Update your playwright.config.ts to use the custom reporter.


Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables
Make sure to set up the SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL environment variable with your Slack webhook URL. You can add this to a .env file in your project root.


Step 5: Run Your Tests
Run your tests as usual, and the custom reporter will send notifications to your Slack channel.


```
npx playwright test
```

Step 6 
If you are facing an error on  require('dotenv').config(); please run below comand.

```
npm install dotenv

```
